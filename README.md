#### 🕹️ Interests:

- **Frontend development**
  - I often try to learn new technologies, currently studying React Native to build more complex projects. 
  - I absolutely love creating new things and building the interactive visual experience the user is supposed to have, and that's probably what makes me love frontend development so much. Making buttons, things and interactions show up and work altogether is an amazing feeling!
- **Design**
  - Mostly as a hobby, I love art and designing things.
  - I also have a huge interest in UX/UI and I usually build those visual projects and prototypes as a hobby. Plus, it's something highly necessary duyring the frontend development, so making everything work together brings me a lot of hype.
